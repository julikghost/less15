The three   doctors met while pursuing  their veterinary education at Colorado State   University, one of the nation&rsquo;s  top-rated vet schools. After going   their own ways (for almost a decade), to  work for different veterinary   clinics across the country, the doctors decided  it was time to combine   their diverse knowledge and skills under one practice at  Wisdom Pet   Medicine.</p></div> </div> <!--row-1-->
