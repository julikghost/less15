  <p>Wisdom Pet Medicine was founded by Dr. Darren Winthrop, Dr.    Elizabeth Chase, and Dr. Kimberly Sanders to bring the best in   traditional and  alternative medicine to the local community. The three   doctors met while pursuing  their veterinary education at Colorado State   University, one of the nation&rsquo;s  top-rated vet schools. After going   their own ways (for almost a decade), to  work for different veterinary   clinics across the country, the doctors decided  it was time to combine   their diverse knowledge and skills under one practice at  Wisdom Pet   Medicine.</p></div>
